# reinforcement_learning
This is a school project, where I taught AI to play snake game, using reinforcement learning and neural networks.
I've followed this tutorial doing this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJl4iabBEz0&list=PLqnslRFeH2UrDh7vUmJ60YrmWd64mTTKV

The game is made with PyGame and the model with PyTorch. The code is thoroughly commented if you wanna understand more how it works.
This it how it looks like while running
