# reinforcement_learning
This is a school project, where I taught AI to play snake game, using reinforcement_learning and neural networks.
I've followed this tutorial doing this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJl4iabBEz0&list=PLqnslRFeH2UrDh7vUmJ60YrmWd64mTTKV

The game is made with PyGame and the model with PyTorch. The code is thoroughly commented if you wanna understand more how it works.
